# On Working Hard

I've never seen this quote before.  I'm not one for quotes usually, but this one really spoke to me on several levels:

* Hard work is a choice, a talent is a gift.
* You choose your work, a talent chooses you.
* Anyone can work hard, not everyone can swing a bat, be a ballerina or launch the next revolutionary technology.

When I was around eight or nine, I feel like I had this existential crisis around talents (or the idea that I didn't have a talent).  To me, a talent was being good at something without working at it.  Talents were also relegated to the world of sports, art and music -- not regular life.  

When I'd be in church and they would tell the story of the talents -- remember that one where the one guy got five talents and doubled them.  The other servant got 3 talents and doubled them, but the last servant was so afraid of losing the one talent he got, that he buried it.  And he was punished.  YIKES.  LESSON: You definitely need to have a talent, figure out what it is and then double it or you are royally screwed.
